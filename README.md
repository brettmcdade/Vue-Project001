Unnamed Kit
===================

## WTF is this?
Pretty much two things:

1. A boilerplate, starter kit, template, framework, or whatever else you want to call it.

2. A workflow to automate the process of building fast, responsible responsive websites




## WTF is in it?
A few things:

1. Build Script

   A grunt build script that compiles Sass, optimizes images, and concatenates and minifies files. Uses BrowserSync for keeping multiple devices synchronized while testing, along with injecting updated CSS and JS into your browser while you're developing (really cool shit). Also creates a PHP server so we can create PHP includes and process forms and stuff locally.

2. Responsive Templates

   Coming soon....


As well as:
